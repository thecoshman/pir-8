A swashbuckling adventure in making a custom computer! YAAAGH!!!

For a long time I've had the unsettling urge to make a computer, I mean _really_ make it. I don't want to just slap a few bits of modern stuff together, I want to go deeper! Sure, using ICs is all well and good, but that doesn't quite do it for me. I want to go down to the level of making it from individual transistors!

## Status/Phase

I'm currently working through fleshing out the ISA, this includes details what registers there will be, what instruction I will offer.

## Goal

Erm... this is mostly just a bit of fun, so I don't really have a fixed end goal. I'd like to get a 'working' system built in hardware, fully out of transistors. How powerful that computer will be, I don't know, let's just see what happens.

## Simulation

I started talking about this project with some friends, one of them happened to be bored enough to start working on a [simulator](https://github.com/TheCatPlusPlus/pir8) for what I have specified.

## Contributions

If you see anything wrong, like I've accidentally specified two operations using the same binary code, or I've a design flaw in the adder wrong, I would massively appreciate you giving me a message ASAP. Down the line, when I start looking to write code, contributions would be cool, once I have real hardware I could maybe video it executing; amazing.
